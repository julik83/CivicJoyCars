            <!-- https://www.classicandsportscar.com/features/buyers-guide-volkswagen-golf-gti-mk2 -->
                <h3>Why MkII?</h3>
                <p>The Golf GTI came of age in Mk2 form: fast, powerful and latterly developed with dual overhead cams, 16 valves plus, ultimately, four-wheel drive and supercharging.</p>
                <br>
                <p>When production ended in ’92, it marked the end of an era: the Mk3 couldn’t hold a candle to it, so the Mk2 was guaranteed future collectable status. Now that most qualify for classic insurance, prices of the best examples are rising.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Compared to Mk1, weight rose 10%, but aerodynamics improved dramatically – drag coefficient dropping from 0.42 to 0.34 thanks to integrated gutters.</p>
                <br>
                <p>With lower, stiffer suspension and bigger front brakes, the 16V was king, but the 8V retains a keen following thanks to a broader torque spread that makes it feel as quick without needing to rev it hard.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Some today feel less responsive, but a good service, curing vacuum leaks and fitting a new genuine Volkswagen blue temperature sender should restore them to sparking health.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Regular servicing is vital, so be happy to pay more for a car with a sheaf of bills that show it has been cherished. A well-kept 8V will do 200,000-plus miles before it needs major work, a 16V 150,000-plus.</p>
            </section>
            <section class="whatchout"> 
                <!-- https://www.classicandsportscar.com/features/buyers-guide-volkswagen-golf-gti-mk2 -->
                <h3>What to whatch out when buying?</h3>
                <p>Some today feel less responsive, but a good service, curing vacuum leaks and fitting a new genuine Volkswagen blue temperature sender should restore them to sparking health.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Mechanical parts are plentiful and many cars are still being broken, which means that rot is usually the biggest enemy. So check all the areas listed carefully, especially the scuttle/bulkhead, floors and front subframe; wet carpets are a bad sign.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Rust often starts around holes (for numberplates and wipers etc) and behind plastic trims. Look also for signs of accident damage, especially panel gaps and front chassis legs, and check the V5 against the VIN plate and engine number.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Engines, both 8V and 16V, are well engineered and durable, with no weaknesses: problems will come from neglect, abuse, wear and age. Hydraulic tappets (fitted from late 1985) may rattle on start-up, but should quickly go quiet. Check service history for most recent cambelt change; inspect condition of oil and coolant, too.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Injection (this is Digifant) is basically reliable, but senders and vacuum hoses can fail and, on K-Jet, the metering head can clog and the airbox flap can stick.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Gearbox is robust, but the change goes sloppy as linkages wear (easily sorted). Feel for worn synchro on second, and ensure fifth doesn’t jump out on overrun.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The cooling system is effective, but any 25-year-old rad will be silted up. Check running temperature and signs of past overheating that may have warped head.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Test all the electronics: trip computer, rev counter, heater blower, rear wiper etc. Age and damp play havoc with solder joints on circuit boards, including the ECU.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Hydraulic tappets that don’t stop rattling are a sure sign of neglected oil changes and will need renewing (and may signify other wear). Cambelts should be swapped every 40,000 miles (or 5-6 years on cars doing low mileages) and the idler should be replaced at the same time. Check the engine starts readily when hot.</p>
                <br>
                <p>A noisy fuel pump (just ahead of the right rear wheel) isn’t a worry, provided it’s not loose or leaking, but a full fuel tank on test may indicate that the lift pump in the tank is on its last legs.</p>
                <br>
                <p>A clicking when cornering is probably a worn CV joint, a front-end knock suggests tired top strut mounts and rumbling indicates a worn wheel bearing. Brakes should be sharp, but rear calipers can seize (as can the compensator valve); check the handbrake, which can be a weak point.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Expect lively performance and sharp, safe handling: if it delivers less,... The trick is to secure one with only minor faults that are easily rectified.</p>
